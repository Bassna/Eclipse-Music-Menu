## Quick Start Guide

Before we dive into the features, here's how to get started. Download and run `MusicMenu.AHK`. Then, press the `F3` hotkey to open the main song menu.

You can optionally download my pre-loaded `MusicList.txt` file with various artists and their entire albums, but it is not required.

If you prefer not to use AutoHotKey, an alternative is to use `MusicMenu.exe`. This executable runs the Music Menu on Windows and is identical to the AHK version.

## User Interface

The Music Menu interface uses hotkeys for quick navigation:

- **F3**: *Open the Main Song menu. Also used to toggle the menu open or closed.*
- **SHIFT + F3**: *Toggle between Full Size and Compact size menus.*
- **CTRL + F3**: *Play a random car song.*
- **ALT + F3**: *Play a speaker song, using the currently set speaker number from the menu.*
- **F12**: *Stop and completely close the Music Menu script.*

In the `OPTIONAL` folder, you'll find:
